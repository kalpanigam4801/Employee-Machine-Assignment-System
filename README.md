# Employee-Machine-Assignment-System
I developed a project on “EMPLOYEE-MACHINE ASSIGNMENT SYSTEM” which is based on the assignment of dozer and dumper to the employees of Mahanadi Coalfields Limited (MCL) - A Subsidiary of Coal India Limited (CIL). I took two excel files as input: employee.xlsx and Machine.xlsx. employee.xlsx file displays the data of employees: Employee Number, Employee ID, Employee Name and Present. The employees present are marked as ‘Y’ and the employees absent are marked as ‘N’. Machine.xlsx file displays the data of machines: Machine Number, Machine ID, Machine Name and Availability. The machines which are available for use are marked as ‘Y’ and the same which are not available for now for use are marked as ‘N’. My work was to assign the available machines: dozer and dumper to the present employees. Here in the project I was using 2 libraries mainly, Pandas and Openpyxl. I was using Pandas for reading the data set, cleaning the data set and moverover interacting with the data sets. I was using Openpyxl just to convert excel file to csv file and vice-versa. After installing these 2 libraries, I read both the datasets using pandas and cleaned them. Then I shuffled the instruments dataset and merged them to other data set and cleaned them. Then I simply converted the csv file to excel file and exported the file locally.
